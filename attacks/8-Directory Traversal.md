**Directory traversal**, also known as **path traversal**, is a critical web vulnerability that allows attackers to access files and directories outside the intended scope of a web application. By manipulating input parameters, attackers can traverse the file system hierarchy to access sensitive files, such as configuration files, password files, or application source code.([Vaadata](https://www.vaadata.com/blog/understanding-preventing-path-traversal-vulnerability/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Understanding & preventing the path traversal vulnerability"))

### üîç How Directory Traversal Works

Web applications often use user-supplied input to specify files or directories. If this input isn't properly validated, attackers can craft input that navigates the file system. For example, using sequences like `../` or its encoded forms (`%2e%2e%2f`) can move the path up one directory level.([Wikip√©dia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_traversal_attack?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Directory traversal attack"))

**Example:**

If an application uses a URL like:

```
https://example.com/view?file=report.pdf
```

An attacker might modify it to:

```
https://example.com/view?file=../../../../etc/passwd
```

This could grant access to the system's password file if proper validations aren't in place.([Hacking Articles](https://www.hackingarticles.in/comprehensive-guide-on-path-traversal/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Comprehensive Guide on Path Traversal - Hacking Articles"))

### üö® Risks of Directory Traversal

- **Unauthorized Access**: Reading sensitive files like `/etc/passwd` or application configuration files.
    
- **Information Disclosure**: Exposing source code, credentials, or internal documentation.
    
- **System Compromise**: In some cases, it can lead to remote code execution or full system takeover.

### üõ°Ô∏è Preventing Directory Traversal

1. **Input Validation**: Strictly validate and sanitize all user inputs. Use allowlists to permit only expected values. ([PullRequest](https://www.pullrequest.com/blog/preventing-directory-traversal-attacks-techniques-and-tips-for-secure-file-access/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Preventing Directory Traversal Attacks: Techniques and Tips for ..."))
    
2. **Canonicalization**: Resolve and normalize file paths before processing. Ensure the resolved path is within the intended directory.
    
3. **Use Safe APIs**: Employ functions that handle file paths securely, such as `realpath()` in PHP or `Path.Combine()` in .NET.([PullRequest](https://www.pullrequest.com/blog/preventing-directory-traversal-attacks-techniques-and-tips-for-secure-file-access/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Preventing Directory Traversal Attacks: Techniques and Tips for ..."))
    
4. **Avoid User-Supplied Paths**: Where possible, avoid using user input to determine file paths.([PortSwigger](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What is path traversal, and how to prevent it? | Web Security Academy"))
    
5. **Least Privilege**: Run applications with the minimal required permissions to limit the impact of a potential breach.([PullRequest](https://www.pullrequest.com/blog/preventing-directory-traversal-attacks-techniques-and-tips-for-secure-file-access/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Preventing Directory Traversal Attacks: Techniques and Tips for ..."))
    
6. **Web Server Configuration**: Configure the web server to restrict access to sensitive directories and files.
    
7. **Regular Security Testing**: Conduct regular code reviews and penetration testing to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.
