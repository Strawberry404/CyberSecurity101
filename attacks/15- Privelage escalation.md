Privilege escalation vulnerabilities pose significant risks to web applications by allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access or elevate their permissions within a system. These vulnerabilities can be categorized into two main types:

- **Horizontal Privilege Escalation**: Occurs when an attacker gains access to resources or functionalities of another user with similar privileges. For example, accessing another user's account information.
    
- **Vertical Privilege Escalation**: Involves an attacker gaining higher-level privileges than initially granted, such as accessing administrative functionalities from a standard user account.([Imperva](https://www.imperva.com/learn/data-security/privilege-escalation/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What is Privilege Escalation | Prevention Techniques - Imperva"))
    

To mitigate these risks, it's essential to implement robust access control mechanisms, validate and sanitize all user inputs, and ensure that sensitive operations are protected against unauthorized access. Regular security assessments and adherence to the principle of least privilege can further strengthen your application's defense against privilege escalation attacks.
