# 🔐 Authentication: Keeping Data, Networks & Apps Safe

Modern apps scale quickly—but so do the **risks** and **attack surfaces**.  
Robust authentication is the first gate : it confirms **who** you are before any authorization rules apply.

## 1 | How Authentication Works 🛠️

| Step | What really happens | Visual |
|------|---------------------|--------|
| 1. **User enters credential** | username + secret (password / biometric / token) | `assets/images/auth_flow_enter.png` *(simple login form)* |
| 2. **Secret is processed locally** | • Password → **hashed** (e.g., bcrypt)  <br>• Fingerprint / Face → **encrypted & stored on device** | `auth_hash_vs_encrypt.svg` *(diagram: hash ≠ encrypt)* |
| 3. **Hash sent to server** | Only the hash travels—never the plain password. |  |
| 4. **Server compares hashes** | If they match → issue a session/token | `auth_flow_compare.png` |

> **Quick analogy:** Matching fingerprints on two glasses – you never move the glass itself, only compare the prints.

## 2 | Common Authentication Methods 🔑

### 2.1 Password-Based

![Flow](images/1/2.png)



* **Problem** : humans reuse “P@ssw0rd!” everywhere → credential-stuffing attacks.  
* **Mitigation example** : enforce length ≥ 12, block breached passwords (see *Have I Been Pwned* API), encourage password managers.

*Image suggestion:*  
`password_strength_meter.png` – a UI meter showing “weak → strong”.

---

### 2.2 Token-Based (TOTP)
![Flow](images/1/3.png)

* **How it works** : App (e.g., Google Authenticator) and server share a secret key → both generate a **6-digit code** that changes every 30 s.  
* **Example** : GitHub “Two-factor code” after password login.

*Image suggestion:*  
`totp_clock.gif` – animated clock + changing 6-digit code.

---

### 2.3 One-Time Password (OTP)
![Flow](images/1/4.png)

* **Delivery** : SMS, email, or hardware token.  
* **Scenario** : PayPal sends a 6-digit SMS code valid for 10 min.  
* **Risk** : SIM-swap attacks can intercept SMS; email OTP relies on email account security.

*Image suggestion:*  
`sms_otp.png` – phone lock-screen with “Your code is 834 221”.

---

### 2.4 Push Notification

![Flow](images/1/5.png)
* **Flow** : Service sends a push (“Approve sign-in?”) to registered device → user taps **Approve**.  
* **Combo** : Often paired with **#2.3 OTP** (“Enter the number showing on your screen”).  
* **Phishing risk** : “Push fatigue” – users blindly hit Approve.

*Image suggestion:*  
`push_auth_prompt.png` – phone banner with Approve / Deny buttons.

---

### 2.5 Multifactor Authentication (MFA)
![Flow](images/1/6.png)


Combine **any two** :

| Factor | Example |
|--------|---------|
| **Something you know** | Password, PIN |
| **Something you have** | Phone with TOTP app, YubiKey |
| **Something you are** | Face ID, fingerprint |

**Real-life use-case** : Azure AD forces password **+** TOTP for admin accounts.

*Image suggestion:*  
`mfa_triangle.svg` – three icons forming a triangle (knowledge, possession, inherence).

---

## 3 | Best-Practice Checklist ✔️

1. **Hash, don’t encrypt, passwords** (bcrypt/Argon2).  
2. Offer **MFA** by default; make it mandatory for admins.  
3. **Rate-limit** login attempts (10 × per hour).  
4. Store **device fingerprints** for push/TOTP to spot anomalies.  
5. Implement **password reset** with the same MFA rigor.

---

## 4 | Key Takeaways

* Passwords alone ≠ enough in 2025.  
* Token & push methods raise the bar; MFA multiplies it.  
* Always balance **security** with **user friction**—good UX keeps users from disabling protection.



# 🚨 Authentication Vulnerabilities: 11 Risks You Must Tame

More than **82 % of breaches involve stolen or weak credentials** (Statista, 2025).  
Knowing *how* attackers slip past login pages is the first step toward shutting them out.

## 0 | Quick Reference 📌

| # | Vulnerability | 5-word memory hook | Suggested visual |
|---|---------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 1 | Flawed brute-force protection | *No lock, endless guesses* | `bruteforce_lockout_chart.png` (bar shows attempts vs lockout) |
| 2 | Weak login credentials | *123456 ≠ security* | `weak_vs_strong_pw_meter.gif` |
| 3 | Username enumeration | *Valid user? Leak says yes* | `enum_error_messages.svg` |
| 4 | HTTP Basic Auth | *Credentials in the clear* | `http_basic_vs_tls.png` |
| 5 | Poor session management | *Hijacked cookie, stolen crown* | `session_hijack_flow.svg` |
| 6 | “Stay logged in” abuse | *Remember me -- forever* | `remember_me_cookie.png` |
| 7 | SQL injection | *‘OR 1=1’ bypass* | `sql_injection_login.gif` |
| 8 | Weak password reset | *Forgot PW? Attacker didn’t* | `reset_email_timeout.png` |
| 9 | Flawed 2FA | *SIM swap beats SMS* | `sim_swap_2fa.png` |
|10 | Vulnerable auth logic | *Skip step, skip auth* | `logic_flaw_flowchart.svg` |
|11 | Human negligence | *Unlocked screen in café* | `shoulder_surfing_photo.jpg` |

---

## 1 | How They Emerge 🔍

* **Gaps in design** – missing lockouts, predictable cookies.  
* **Coding errors** – unchecked SQL strings, bad logic flow.  
* **User habits** – password reuse, devices left unlocked.

> **Tip:** Map each vulnerability to *People / Process / Technology* when doing a risk review.

## 2 | Deep Dive into Each Vulnerability 🧨

### 1️⃣ Flawed Brute-Force Protection
![Flow](images/1/7.png)
*Attack*: Automated guessing of credentials.  
*Real-world fail*: 2022 Uber leak via unthrottled VPN portal.  
*Fix fast*: Rate-limit, CAPTCHA after N attempts, IP reputation block.

---

### 2️⃣ Weak Login Credentials
![Flow](images/1/8.png)
*Attack*: Use leaked or common passwords.  
*Example*: “Spring23!” reused across SaaS tools.  
*Fix fast*: Block breached passwords (HIBP API), enforce ≥ 12 chars, enable password managers.

---

### 3️⃣ Username Enumeration
![Flow](images/1/9.png)
*Attack*: Error message reveals valid usernames.  
*Example*: “Username not found” vs “Password incorrect”.  
*Fix fast*: Generic failure message + same response time.

---

### 4️⃣ HTTP Basic Authentication
*Attack*: Credentials sent each request; sniffable without TLS.  
*Example*: IoT dashboards shipped with basic auth over HTTP.  
*Fix fast*: Enforce HTTPS (HSTS), prefer bearer tokens / OAuth.

---

### 5️⃣ Poor Session Management
![Flow](images/1/10.png)
*Attack*: Session ID stolen → hijack.  
*Examples*  
- Session ID in URL (`?PHPSESSID=`)  
- Cookie lacks **HttpOnly/SameSite**  
*Fix fast*: Regenerate ID post-login, set `Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax`, shorten idle timeouts.

---

### 6️⃣ “Stay Logged In” Abuse
*Attack*: Predictable or XSS-stolen cookies keep attacker logged in.  
*Fix fast*: Encrypt cookie payload, bind to device fingerprint, 30-day max TTL.

---

### 7️⃣ SQL Injection
![Flow](images/1/11.png)
*Attack*: Malicious SQL leaks password hashes or returns *true* on login.  
*Fix fast*: Parameterized queries / ORM, WAF rules, least-privileged DB user.

---

### 8️⃣ Weak Password Reset
*Attack*: Guessable security Qs, no OTP timeout.  
*Fix fast*: Use time-bound, single-use links or TOTP; add CAPTCHAs; log & alert unusual resets.

---

### 9️⃣ Flawed Two-Factor Authentication
*Attack*: SIM swap intercepts SMS; no lockout on 6-digit codes.  
*Fix fast*: Prefer TOTP or WebAuthn; limit attempts; notify out-of-band on new device.

---

### 🔟 Vulnerable Authentication Logic
*Attack*: Skip or replay steps due to coding oversight.  
*Example*: Missing check that OTP belongs to same user as password.  
*Fix fast*: Threat-model workflows; peer review auth flows; add unit tests.

---

### 1️⃣1️⃣ Human Negligence
![Flow](images/1/12.png)
*Attack*: Stolen laptop, shoulder-surfing in coffee shop.  
*Fix fast*: Security training, auto-lock screens, remote wipe.

---

## 3 | Prevention Cheat-Sheet ✅

1. **Lock & log** brute-force attempts (5 tries → 15 min lock).  
2. **Ban weak / known-breached passwords** at signup & reset.  
3. **Enforce MFA** for all admins; offer it to every user.  
4. **Encrypt every hop** (TLS 1.3, HSTS, pinned certs).  
5. **Harden cookies** (`Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax`).  
6. **Pentest auth flows** at least yearly; patch logic bugs fast.  
7. **Train humans**—they’re part of the control stack.

---

## 4 | Key Takeaway

> **Authenticate hard, authorize smart, audit always.**  
> Every leaked credential is a free ticket for attackers—shut the gate before they arrive.
