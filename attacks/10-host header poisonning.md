**Host Header Poisoning**, also known as **Host Header Injection**, is a web vulnerability that arises when an application improperly trusts the `Host` header from HTTP requests. This can lead to various attacks, including web cache poisoning, password reset hijacking, and server-side request forgery (SSRF).([Application Security Testing Company](https://www.aptive.co.uk/blog/what-is-host-header-injection/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What Is Host Header Injection?

### üß† What Is the HTTP Host Header?

The `Host` header is a mandatory component of HTTP/1.1 requests, specifying the domain name of the server the client wishes to communicate with. For example:([Indusface](https://www.indusface.com/learning/host-header-injection/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Host Header Injection: Risks and Prevention - Indusface"))

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
```

Web servers use this header to determine which virtual host should handle the request, especially when multiple domains are served from the same IP address.([Application Security Testing Company](https://www.aptive.co.uk/blog/what-is-host-header-injection/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What Is Host Header Injection?

### üö® How Host Header Poisoning Works

When a web application uses the `Host` header value without proper validation, attackers can manipulate it to:([fastly.com](https://www.fastly.com/learning/security/what-are-http-host-header-attacks?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What are HTTP host header attacks? - Fastly"))

- **Web Cache Poisoning**: Inject malicious content into a cache, causing subsequent users to receive the poisoned content. ([appsecengineer.com](https://www.appsecengineer.com/blog/demystifying-host-header-attacks-understanding-exploitation-resilient-defenses?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Demystifying Host Header Attacks: Understanding, Exploitation ..."))
    
- **Password Reset Poisoning**: Forge password reset links sent to users, redirecting them to attacker-controlled domains. ([fastly.com](https://www.fastly.com/learning/security/what-are-http-host-header-attacks?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What are HTTP host header attacks? - Fastly"))
    
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**: Trick the server into making unintended requests, potentially accessing internal systems. ([fastly.com](https://www.fastly.com/learning/security/what-are-http-host-header-attacks?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What are HTTP host header attacks? - Fastly"))
    
- **Phishing Attacks**: Redirect users to malicious sites that mimic legitimate ones, stealing sensitive information.

### üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation Strategies

To protect against Host Header Poisoning:

1. **Avoid Using Unvalidated Host Headers**: Do not use the `Host` header value for security decisions or URL generation.([fastly.com](https://www.fastly.com/learning/security/what-are-http-host-header-attacks?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What are HTTP host header attacks? - Fastly"))
    
2. **Implement a Whitelist of Allowed Hostnames**: Configure the application to accept only known, valid hostnames.([Invicti](https://www.invicti.com/learn/host-header-attacks/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Host Header Attacks - Invicti"))
    
3. **Use Relative URLs**: Where possible, use relative URLs instead of absolute ones that rely on the `Host` header.
    
4. **Sanitize and Validate Input**: Ensure all user inputs, including headers, are properly sanitized and validated.
    
5. **Configure Web Servers Appropriately**: Set up web servers to reject requests with invalid or unrecognized `Host` headers.
    
6. **Employ Security Tools**: Use web application firewalls (WAFs) and vulnerability scanners to detect and prevent such attacks.
